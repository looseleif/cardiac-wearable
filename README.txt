Cardiac Wearable Device for Senior Design 4951W
aWear, a watch attachment device used for proactive cardiac symptom monitoring


We are working on a wearable device focused on the detection of cardiac symptoms related to atrial fibrillation and other associated diseases.

This team consists of Chase Anderson, Seth Gunderson, Vaibhav Shirole, Yuriy Shevchenko, and Matthew Kukla.

Firmware:

	Our plan is to get the baseline functionality completed using Arduino/AVR based microcontroller. This includes PPG sensor reading, PPG signal processing, BLE connectivity, IMU algorithm implementation, power management. Following the prototype programming being done on a bluetooth low-energy nrf52840 board.

Hardware:

	This will include the design portion of the device schematic and PCB that will be fabricated through JLC PCB. We currently plan to design a simple 2 layer board that will have a protected side involing the processor and supporting circuitry, and the other business end that will ontain the LEDs and PPG sensor. This device is planned to be attached to an existing watch so we wish to keep the form factor small, lightweight, and acceptable as a non-intrusive human support device.
