            Paroxysmal AFib are episodes of AFib that occur occasionally and usually stop spontaneously. 
            Episodes can last a few seconds, hours or a few days before stopping 
            and returning to normal sinus rhythm, which is the heart's normal rhythm.

            It's not uncommon for you to develop persistent or chronic AFib if you've had paroxysmal AFib.
            Research has shown that 9 to 30 percent of all cases of paroxysmal AFib progress into more chronic cases after 1 year.

            <strong>aWear gives a recommendation, but not a diagnosis.</strong> 
            See a doctor as soon as pososible for a proper check. 

            If you have paroxysmal AFib, your doctor may recommend restoration of the normal heart rhythm. 
            To do this, your doctor may try to reset the normal rhythm with medications or electric shock, also known as cardioversion.

            Your doctor may suggest an antiarrhythmic medication, such as amiodarone (Cordarone) 
            or propafenone (Rythmol), even when normal rhythm has returned. 
            They also may prescribe beta-blockers or calcium channel blockers to control your heart rate.
