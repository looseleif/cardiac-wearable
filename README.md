### What is aWear
Atrial fibrillation is an irregular heartbeat or arrhythmia that can lead to stroke, heart failure, and other heart complications. [7] A severe lack of affordable and easy-to-use, passive, and noninvasive monitoring devices for atrial fibrillation prompted the development of aWear. aWear is a device designed to detect atrial fibrillation in patients passively and wirelessly. The device is designed to be inconspicuous and noninvasive and worn under a regular watch. It monitors the userâ€™s heart activities and if atrial fibrillation is suspected, warns the user. This device uses photoplethysmography to monitor the heart. Detection of atrial fibrillation is done by calculating the coefficient of variation and the turning point ratio after the signal is filtered. The results were a wearable device that lasts approximately 72 hours on a charge and detects atrial fibrillation with an accuracy of 90.48% while remaining under $50 in production cost.
